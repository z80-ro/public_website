      <description>Following the articles from this point on might require some prior Verilog+FPGA knowledge.
My plan is to skip the boring part from every book/tutorial and jump into action head first. I preffer learning from increasingly difficult examples along the way than read about every boring detail, get tired and abandon hope altogether. For me this approach generates less questions and when they do arise they are usually important, leading to A-HA!</description>

      <description>First let&amp;rsquo;s get this out of the way: I use Linux
Technically these tools should be platform-agnostic and work on other OSes like Windows or MacOS.
I use Linux Mint and whenever I start fresh with a new environment I like to install the following packages:
sudo apt update sudo apt install git tig zsh tmux neovim mc htop build-essential python3 python3-pip yasm p7zip p7zip-full gparted -y  IceStorm tools Most of these steps were copied from the project&amp;rsquo;s page and improved/updated.</description>

      <description>I started to tell a story and three hours later I was still not done. It was supposed to be a short trip down the memory lane but situation escalated quickly.

 It was a regular school day in mid &amp;rsquo;80s when my teacher came in the class and told everybody she needs to select a few kids to attend a computer course.</description>
